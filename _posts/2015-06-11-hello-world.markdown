This thing I'm making is because I was inspired to get better by Shipping. Shipping alot. Shipping when it hurts. Shipping until you can't ship any more.

I was inspired by [Jen DeWalt][1] who learned to program by making [180 websites in 180 days][3]. What's funny is that while I had heard of her project and seen it various places online, I had no idea when I actually met her in person. She just seemed like this really driven, smart programmer.

Anyways, I saw a video of her online today: [JSConf.ar 2014][2]

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaSbL4sRff8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It just inspired me. She made games, physics simulations, tools. She went kinda deep into CSS. She was kinda free in a really interesting and appealing way.

Oddly, I was also inspired by [Liz Krane][4] who also tweeted that she was inspired by Jen to start her own project, [30 Days of Web Dev][5].
I also have to link to her [Google+][6] page for the project because it has animated Gifs of each day's work.

So, it's 4:30AM and I have work tomorrow so, I better wrap up. I just wanted to make sure I shipped something.

- What can I dedicate myself to?
- Is this even a good idea to make a decision at 4:30AM on a school nite?
- What am I trying to learn?
- What will I do?
One answer for all of those questions: [#jfdi][7] (Shoutouts to [@levelsio][8])

## 30 Days of Shipping.
I wonder what I'll push tomorrow. *I have no idea and that's the best part.*

**Today:**

* Day 1 - This hello world.

**P.S.** *- I forgot how fun it is to just write freeform in HTML and how much Markdown makes writing HTML better but, at the end of the day, it's just HTML.*

I'm writing this in Jekyll and I wanted to link that youtube video of Jen's JSConf.ar talk. I found myself looking for a Jekyll Youtube plugin when I had a facepalm moment and realized I could just copy and paste to embed an iframe with the video.

It's my HTML, *can't nobody tell me nothin!* And HTML is a wonderful thing, simple and full of joy.
